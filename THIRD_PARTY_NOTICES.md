Vendored script attribution:

- marked: Copyright (c) 2018+ MarkedJS and Copyright (c) 2011–2018
  Christopher Jeffrey; its Markdown compatibility code retains the upstream
  John Gruber attribution and BSD-style terms.
- DOMPurify: Copyright 2025–2026 Dr.-Ing. Mario Heiderich, Cure53.
- chrome-devtools-mcp: Modified by Pinvou Agent during vendoring:
  `build/src/McpResponse.js` adds the `target_id` field to structured page
  entries so the host can enforce conversation and tab ownership. The adapted
  output is pinned by SHA-256.
- Tailwind CSS: Copyright (c) Tailwind Labs, Inc.
- Material Icon Theme: Copyright (c) 2025 Material Extensions. The glyphs
  were exported from the
  [Iconify Material Icon Theme collection](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/material-icon-theme/);
  Iconify is used only as the export source and is not a runtime dependency.
- Material Icon Theme (file/folder icon subset): Copyright (c) 2025 Material
  Extensions. The SVGs in `pinvou3-app/src/file-icons/theme/` were downloaded
  from the upstream `icons/` directory (`csv.svg` is upstream `table.svg`);
  `file.svg`, `folder.svg`, and `folder-open.svg` are build-time defaults the
  upstream repository does not commit, reproduced verbatim from the upstream
  generator source (`src/core/generator`, default color `#90a4ae`).

Detailed license texts and upstream notices for bundled connectors are kept
next to their resources under `pinvou3-app/src-tauri/resources/`.

The exact connector URLs and SHA-256 checksums are recorded in the per-platform
`connectors.lock.json` manifests under
`pinvou3-app/src-tauri/resources/platforms/<os>/<arch>/bundle/connectors/`
(real path segments: `linux/aarch64`, `linux/x86_64`, `macos/aarch64`,
`macos/x86_64`, `windows/x86_64`; the lock files' `platform` fields use the
compact `linux-arm64`-style names), and are
fetched on first use by the app itself; `scripts/fetch-connectors.sh` is the CI/reviewer helper that materializes the same artifacts for verification.

## Package dependencies and SBOM

Rust, npm, and other manifest-managed dependencies are recorded in the live
[SPDX SBOM](docs/sbom.md) generated by GitHub's dependency graph. Dependency
changes are reviewed in pull requests for known vulnerabilities and license
metadata.

## Assets and trademarks

Except for components and icon glyphs identified above, the application
images, screenshots, pet sprites, and Pinvou visual assets in this repository
were created for Pinvou and are not imported third-party asset packs. Service
icons and product names may reproduce third-party marks only to identify
compatible integrations.

Product names and trademarks belong to their respective owners. Inclusion
does not imply endorsement or grant trademark rights. See
[`TRADEMARKS.md`](TRADEMARKS.md).
