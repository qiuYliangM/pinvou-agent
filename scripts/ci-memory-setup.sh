# CI Linux runner memory setup (best effort, never fatal).
#
# Facts measured on 2026-09-15 with probes on all three hosted images
# (ubuntu-22.04, ubuntu-24.04, ubuntu-22.04-arm; probes run in the sibling
# repo Pinvou/pinvou3):
#   - Hosted runners are single-disk: / and /mnt are the same ext4
#     (/dev/sda1). x64 images total 72G; with the 16G /mnt/swapfile an
#     earlier version of this script created, the build had only ~13-14
#     GiB of disk left — the direct cause of the release ENOSPC failures —
#     and arm ~34 GiB. A swapfile on /mnt therefore eats the build disk
#     directly, so disk swap is no longer created by default.
#   - The Pinvou/pinvou3 hosted runner is 2-core / 7.8 GiB RAM (free -h);
#     the "16 GiB RAM" claimed by older comments was the public-repo
#     runner spec.
#
# Swap layers, preferred first:
#   1. zram: zstd, priority 100; the virtual device is sized to 2x RAM at
#      runtime (from MemTotal), compressed pages never touch disk, and the
#      compressed pool is capped at 70% of RAM (mem_limit) so an
#      incompressible workload cannot eat the runner's whole memory through
#      zram itself. zram was already the unconditional first layer before
#      this tuning; the 2026-09-19 round only changes the compressor
#      (lz4 -> zstd), the device size (fixed 24 GiB -> 2x RAM) and the pool
#      cap (50% -> 70% of RAM). Qualified on all three hosted images by the
#      Pinvou/pinvou3 probes via modprobe zram ->
#      (on failure: activate the image swapfile first if nothing is active,
#      then apt-get install linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r), then modprobe
#      again) -> zstd -> 2x-RAM disksize -> mem_limit -> mkswap ->
#      swapon -p 100.
#      The 2026-09-12 hosted job hangs once blamed on zram (Pinvou/pinvou3
#      run 34708283784) were re-classified as a transient environment
#      incident: the same script ran green with zram loaded in this repo
#      the same day. The countermeasure is structural, not a rollback: every
#      userspace external call (modprobe, apt-get, fallocate, mkswap,
#      swapon, swapoff) runs under `timeout` with a SIGKILL backstop, and
#      any failure degrades loudly to the next layer. Residual risk that no
#      userspace measure can remove: an in-kernel hang (module load or a
#      stuck sysfs write) is uninterruptible; the workflow-side
#      `timeout 240` + non-fatal wrapper is the last line there, and
#      PINVOU3_CI_DISABLE_ZRAM=1 is the standing opt-out.
#   2. /mnt/swapfile (priority 10), 8 GiB, provisioned on EVERY runner:
#      swap is mandatory, not opt-in (2026-09-19 decision) — with the zram
#      pool hard-capped at 70% of RAM, this is the only unbounded overflow
#      layer. The safety guards stay: /mnt is skipped when tmpfs (RAM
#      backed) or too small, the file is capped at 60% of actual free
#      space, and an image-provided /mnt/swapfile is rebuilt in place. On
#      the single-disk hosted images this costs 8G of build disk — a
#      deliberate trade for the memory ceiling.
#   3. Image swapfile as last resort: only when the runner came up with
#      zero active swap (probe data: some ubuntu-22.04 boots ship /swapfile
#      but leave it inactive), activate it so a zram or disk-swap failure
#      degrades to "plain swap" instead of "7.8 GiB RAM and nothing else".
#   4. zswap in front of whatever swap remains: enabled only when no
#      /dev/zram swap is active, and disabled again when zram is active
#      (stock Ubuntu kernels ship zswap enabled by default), so the
#      "compress in RAM first" layer exists exactly once.
#
# Environment switches (they survive the workflow wrappers'
# `sudo --preserve-env` alongside GITHUB_ACTIONS; sudo env_reset would
# otherwise strip them from the job env, silently no-op'ing the opt-out):
#   PINVOU3_CI_DISABLE_ZRAM=1      skip zram entirely (explicit opt-out for
#                                  future incidents; zram has been the
#                                  default first layer since this script
#                                  was introduced). There is no disk-swap
#                                  switch: the /mnt swapfile is mandatory.
#
# Capacity trade in the default configuration: the zram pool stays
# hard-capped (an uncapped pool is the plausible mechanism of the
# 2026-09-12 "runner lost communication" incident, and an OOM-kill that
# leaves logs beats a lost runner). The 2026-09-19 round resized the disk
# swap to 8G and made it mandatory again (it was an unconditional 16G
# file until the single-disk ENOSPC findings made it opt-in): zram at
# 2x RAM is the primary absorber and the swapfile is the unbounded
# overflow beyond the 70% pool cap, at the price of 8G build disk on the
# single-disk hosted images.
#
# Kernel tunables (each knob independent, failure only warns):
#   vm.swappiness=130 (>=100 shifts reclaim towards anonymous pages, i.e.
#   actually use the swap layers above), vm.watermark_scale_factor=300 and
#   vm.min_free_kbytes=65536 (wake kswapd earlier and keep a deeper
#   emergency reserve so the runner agent's heartbeat survives link peaks),
#   vm.overcommit_memory=1 (never refuse mmap; let swap absorb peaks
#   instead of failing allocations).
#
# The pinvou3 workspace (700+ crates, ThinLTO, dep-level O2) repeatedly
# exhausts the stock memory budget in rust-test; before memory provisioning
# existed the failure mode was "hosted runner lost communication" with all
# logs lost. Every Linux job runs this script right after checkout
# (enforced by the gate policy test, which requires the wrapped, non-fatal
# call on every ubuntu job — rust-lint included; its lint-only workload
# would fit in stock memory, but the uniform wrapper keeps the policy
# checkable).
