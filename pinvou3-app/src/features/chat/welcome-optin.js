// the model can receive the tool. Extracted as a pure module so it can be
// node-tested directly like scene-capabilities (the project has no React test
// infrastructure yet). Failure does not block the send (fail-visible: the
// caller shows a notice based on failed, and the tool's absence is visible in
// the reply); errors are never swallowed silently.

// consumed the ref (consume() clears it at attempt start), not that no card
