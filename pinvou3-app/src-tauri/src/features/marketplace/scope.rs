//! 包 id × SessionMode 的单一禁用集（`~/.pinvou3/disabled_bundles.json`）。
//!
//! 这是「工具市场统一治理」scope 收敛的单一真相源：取代原先
//! `disabled_connectors.json`（连接器 id）与 `disabled_skills.json`（技能 id）两份
//! 文件。开关粒度收敛为**包 id**（= `bundle.rs` 里 `BundleInfo.id`，即 MCP 工具 id /
//! 技能 id / CLI 连接器 id），一个包 = 一个开关，包内技能（companion skills）可见性
//! 唯一跟随所属包（§5.2 不变量）。
//!
//! On-disk format, isomorphic to the #287-generalized legacy pair: `{scopes, hidden_scopes,
//! default_off_scopes: {"<mode>": [...]}, initialized: ["<mode>"],
//! project_skills_enabled, plain_defaults_migrated}`. Scope keys use `SessionMode`
//! kebab-case names. `plain_defaults_migrated`: marks files written while plain
//! was still AllowAll; migrate-on-read initializes plain to the persisted list
//! and lands the marker on disk. First read migrates the two legacy files
//! into this file (migrate-on-read):
//! Legacy connector ids pass through as pack ids (connector id = pack id); legacy
//! skill ids map to their owner via `to_package_id` (the gating mapping `skill_gating_owner` since R17-MAJOR1);
//! `skill:` prefix residue is stripped. Migration is idempotent; failure falls back to defaults (safe).
//!
// architecture-guard: allow-target-cfg -- the unix regression tests in this file (the round-13 B3 install-sync persist failure and the round-14 #2 freeze memo) need unreadable (0o555 directory / 0o000 file) fixtures; test-only inline cfg(unix)+PermissionsExt (same exemption precedent as mod.rs / package_export.rs, review #455); a real open() probe guards against running as root, Windows is covered by link checks.

//! 依赖方向：本模块与 `bundle` / `skill_marketplace` 同属 marketplace 领域，只依赖
