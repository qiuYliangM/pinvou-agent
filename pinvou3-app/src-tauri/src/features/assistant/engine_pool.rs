//! Engine pool for concurrent multi-session use.
//!
//! Old model: one Engine for the whole process; switching sessions replaced
//! the entire internal state via `Op::SyncSession`
//! → only one session could be served at a time, and switching away from a
//! running session crosstailed them.
//!
//! New model: **one independent Engine per session** (the foundation's
//! `spawn_engine` is an independent factory, see
//! [`AppEngine::spawn_for_session`]). This pool manages the lifecycle of
//! those engines by `session_id`:
//!  - **lazy spawn**: spawn only when a session gets its first message (with
//!    that session's own workspace + instructions); a session with existing
//!    on-disk history is hydrated with a one-shot `SyncSession` after spawn.
//!  - **idle reclaim (a tightening of the old keep-alive policy)**: after
//!    spawn an engine stays resident and background sessions keep running
//!    their turns, but no longer forever — each engine is an in-process task
//!    + its own channel/toolset, the pool is unbounded and memory grows
//!    linearly with session count. A background sweep (`start_idle_reaper`)
//!    reclaims engines that have been "idle for more than
//!    `IDLE_EVICT_AFTER_SECS` with no in-flight turn and not active";
//!    reclaiming only returns to lazy-spawn semantics — the next message
//!    rebuilds via `get_or_spawn` and rehydrates with `SyncSession`,
//!    losslessly.
//!  - **evict**: reclaim on session deletion (cancel the running turn +
//!    Shutdown the engine + abort the forwarder).
//!
//! The pool itself is Tauri State; chat / cancel / submit_user_input etc. in
//! `commands.rs` all route to the corresponding engine by `session_id`.
//!
//! Concurrency note: runtime model preparation may access an external
//! credential service and must not hold the global `entries` lock. Each
//! session first serializes prepare/compare/rebuild through its own runtime
//! lock, then briefly holds `entries` to complete the local spawn — avoiding
//! duplicate engines for the same session at the root, and never letting a
//! slow credential service block other sessions.

/// otherwise `cancel_current` would hit the new turn's live token, and a
/// mismatch found in phase two could not be withdrawn.
///
/// **arm-order constraint**: `arm_pending_cancel` must run before every

///
/// `get_engine` returns the in-pool engine handle (`None` means no engine —

///
/// `cancel_current` synchronously cancels the engine's current token
/// (idempotent; runs in both phase one and phase two; implementations may

/// same-source turn identity that `arm_pending_cancel_and_cancel` captured
/// under the **same lifecycle state lock** (`Some`): the closure runs inside
/// that critical section and arbitrates turn-bound on that identity, never
/// on a stale view taken outside the lock. The defensive branches without a
/// lifecycle receive `None` and converge with the terminal-closing verdict:
/// disposition only, never fire (issue #254). `cascade_cancel` asynchronously
/// sends the cascade cancel (CancelSubAgents) and is **only awaited in phase
/// two while holding the `turn_lock`**:
/// guaranteeing the cascade cancel is enqueued before the turn gate is
/// released — the next turn's `SendMessage` must wait on the same
/// `turn_lock` (`send_reserved_user_message`), so the cascade cancel is
/// always enqueued before the new turn's message, and FIFO guarantees the
/// engine cancels the old turn's sub-agents before starting the new turn;
/// a late cascade cancel cannot mistakenly kill the new turn's just-started
/// sub-agents (reviewer point 4: an async spawn send loses the enqueue-order
/// guarantee relative to the next turn's SendMessage).
///
/// Every call is bounded by [`TURN_GATE_AWAIT_TIMEOUT`] (issue #255): a
/// stalled engine run loop (ops channel full and never draining) must not

/// is abandoned — the only cost is that the old turn's subagents on the
/// stalled engine stay alive until the engine unstalls or is reclaimed (the
/// subagents' own step/time budgets bound them). A late cascade cancel cannot
/// kill a new gate-submitted turn's subagents: the dropped send is guaranteed
/// never enqueued by tokio mpsc send's cancel-safety (the acquired permit is
/// returned when the future is dropped), and every gate-held sender plus the
/// next turn's `SendMessage` are serialized on the same turn gate, while
/// phase-1's `try_send` is covered by the in-lock epoch check under the
/// lifecycle state lock + FIFO — the ordering guarantee does not rely on "the
/// channel staying full". The guarantee covers turns the app submits under
/// the gate; engine-autonomous turns (idle-subagent finishing, goal
/// continuation) start without the gate and are adopted by the forwarder only
/// at `TurnStarted`, a pre-existing window outside this guarantee.
///
/// **Cascade-cancel delivery guard** (reviewer point 9 + G1 resend
