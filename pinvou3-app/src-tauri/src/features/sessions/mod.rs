//! Multi-conversation management wrapper (facade + submodules).
//!
//! Reuses the upstream deepseek-tui [`SessionManager`](deepseek_tui::session_manager::SessionManager) (which already supports `new(custom_dir)`),
//! directing the sessions directory to `~/.pinvou3/sessions/` (isolated from `~/.deepseek/`).
//!
//! Capabilities exposed to pinvou3-app Tauri commands:
//! - `list` — list all session metadata (frontend history panel)
//! - `create_new` — create a new empty session (before the first message is sent)
//! - `load` — read the full conversation (injected into the engine via `Op::SyncSession` on session switch)
//! - `save` — persist (auto-save after each turn completes)
//! - `delete` — delete session + artifacts directory
//! - `set_title` — rename
//! - `active_id` / `set_active` — track the current active session (chat command surface)
//!
//! **Arc + RwLock wrapping**: every field is an `Arc`, so the whole
//! `SessionStore` can be cheaply Cloned into Tauri State + shared across tasks.
//!
//! Historically this file was a 3700+ line god-module mixing 7 kinds of
//! responsibility. Wave 2 task 2d split it into a facade (this file, keeping
//! the struct definitions + constants) + submodules:
//!
//! - `store` — session storage CRUD / lifecycle / engine-state persistence entry
//! - `scheduled` — scheduled-run profile / engine-state types and registry
//! - `retention` — retention policy and the `persist_then_reconcile` helper family
//! - `transcript` — transcript revision / truncation protection
//! - `mode_state` — per-session mode state machine (mode/plan/persona/skill)
//! - `injections` — one-shot injections and the plan-claim transactional checkout guard
//! - `sidecars` — independent sidecar persistence for skill bindings / model / pin / collapse
//! - `rewind` — conversation truncation for code-mode rewind and the `_rewound_turns.json` backup
//! - `validators` — id / workspace / path validation and small helpers
//! - `workspace_bindings` —— per-session sidecar of plain chat sessions' user
//!   working-directory bindings (`workspace-binding.json` in the session
//!   directory)
//!
//! Submodules continue the methods via `impl SessionStore` (Rust allows impl
//! blocks of the same struct to be scattered across submodules) and read
//! `&self`'s private fields directly — struct fields are visible to descendant
//! modules. The pub surface is re-exported centrally in this file, keeping
//! external call paths unchanged.
